            <h2 class="reveal">Purpose</h2>
            <p class="reveal">Football boots are the most critical piece of equipment a player wears. Yet even at the highest professional level, they are not truly custom. Players receive superficial personalization: colors, initials, minor width adjustments. The boot itself remains a mass-produced product, built around statistical averages rather than individual anatomy.</p>
            <p class="reveal">Alveon exists to change this. We are building the world's first football boots that are genuinely made to measure: designed from a player's individual 3D foot scan, informed by biomechanical data, and manufactured entirely with 3D technologies. Not as a luxury novelty, but as an evidence-based approach to injury prevention, career protection, and performance optimization.</p>

            <h2 class="reveal">Mission</h2>
            <blockquote class="quote-block reveal">
                To eliminate the gap between a player's individual needs and the equipment they depend on. Through science, data, and advanced manufacturing.
            </blockquote>

            <h2 class="reveal">Vision</h2>
            <blockquote class="quote-block reveal">
                A world where every professional football player wears boots built specifically for them. Reducing injuries, extending careers, and unlocking the performance potential that mass production leaves on the table.

        <!-- 03 Origin Story -->
        <section class="chapter" id="origin">
            <div class="chapter__header reveal">
                <span class="chapter__number">03</span>
                <h1 class="chapter__title">Origin Story</h1>
            </div>

            <p class="chapter__lead reveal">The Alveon story doesn't start with a eureka moment. It starts with a question that kept coming back.</p>

            <p class="reveal">Co-founder Jurgen was never a great football player. By his own account, his teammates were not particularly sad when he quit. But years later, through work in the sports industry, he gained access to a world he hadn't seen before: the daily reality of professional players. The pressure, the details, the ecosystem around performance.</p>

            <p class="reveal">In conversations with players, one pattern emerged consistently: they don't really have custom boots. Even at the top level, what passes for customization is surprisingly rudimentary. Limited options, long lead times, little real adaptation to the individual foot.</p>

            <p class="reveal">Around the same time, Jurgen met Lennard, co-founder of Zellerfeld, a company building 3D-printed footwear. Over coffee, they kept returning to the same question: Why are football boots not fully custom? Built on real data. Adjusted to individual anatomy, movement patterns, and injury history.</p>

            <p class="reveal">They discussed the idea for nearly two years. Not because they lacked enthusiasm, but because they took the question seriously. Who were they to say what the perfect boot should look like? Which parameters actually matter? And how do you prove scientifically that your approach is better than what exists?</p>

            <p class="reveal">That rigor led to the decision to build Alveon not as a product company that also does some research, but as a company where science leads product development. In early 2026, a joint research initiative was launched with three of Germany's leading institutions: the Deutsche Sporthochschule Koln for biomechanics, UKE Hamburg for clinical validation, and Fraunhofer IAPT for materials and manufacturing research.</p>

            <p class="reveal">The founding principle remains: the boot should be as individual as the player wearing it. Everything else follows from there.</p>

            <h2 class="reveal">Why This Story Matters for the Brand</h2>
            <div class="callout reveal">
                <p>The origin story is strategically important because it communicates several brand truths simultaneously: intellectual honesty (we started by admitting what we didn't know), scientific credibility (we built a research consortium before building a product), and authentic motivation (born from a real observation, not from a market gap analysis). It positions the founders as thoughtful rather than reckless. That matters for a company asking players to trust its product with their careers.</p>

                <span class="chapter__number">04</span>
                <h1 class="chapter__title">Market Context & Positioning</h1>
            </div>

            <h2 class="reveal">The Current Landscape</h2>
            <p class="reveal">The global football boot market is dominated by Nike, Adidas, Puma, and New Balance. These brands invest heavily in material innovation, athlete endorsements, and consumer marketing. Their products are excellent mass-market solutions, developed with significant R&D budgets and global distribution infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="reveal">However, their business model is fundamentally built on scale: produce millions of identical units across a limited range of sizes and widths. Even "custom" offerings from major brands are typically limited to cosmetic personalization (colors, nameplates) and minor fit adjustments within predefined molds.</p>
            <p class="reveal">For the vast majority of professional players, boots are selected from existing product lines and modified post-purchase through insoles, stretching, or cutting. The boot adapts marginally to the foot; the foot adapts significantly to the boot.</p>

            <h2 class="reveal">The Gap We Address</h2>
            <p class="reveal">Alveon operates in a category that doesn't properly exist yet: fully individualized professional football footwear, built from individual biomechanical data and manufactured through digital fabrication.</p>
            <p class="reveal">We are not competing with Nike or Adidas for shelf space. We are not a consumer brand. We are a technology company that creates the capability to produce boots that major brands currently cannot offer. Their manufacturing infrastructure is designed for volume, not for individualization.</p>

            <h2 class="reveal">Competitive Differentiation</h2>

                    <dt>B2B Technology Model</dt>
                    <dd>Alveon's primary commercial model is not selling individual boots to consumers. It is licensing complete scan-to-boot installations (Performance Centers) to clubs, federations, and brands.</dd>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2 class="reveal">Positioning Statement</h2>
            <blockquote class="quote-block reveal">
                Alveon is the technology company building truly individualized football boots. Where existing brands optimize for millions, we engineer for one. Combining 3D scanning, biomechanical research, and digital manufacturing to create footwear that fits the player, not the average.

            <!-- Audience: Players -->
            <div class="audience-card reveal">
                <h3 class="audience-card__title">Professional Football Players</h3>
                <p class="audience-card__desc">First-team players at top-tier clubs (top 5 European leagues, international teams). These athletes depend on their boots for performance and injury prevention, yet have limited control over what they wear.</p>

                <h4 class="audience-card__sub">Pain Points</h4>
                <p>Boots that don't fit properly cause blisters, discomfort, and contribute to foot and ankle injuries. Customization from existing sponsors is slow and cosmetic. Players often cut, stretch, or modify boots themselves. Boot changes during injury recovery are disruptive.</p>

                <h4 class="audience-card__sub">Alveon Delivers</h4>
                <p>Boots built from their individual 3D scan and biomechanical profile. Clinically validated injury reduction. Rapid iteration when needs change. A product that treats their feet as the high-value assets they are.</p>

                <p class="audience-card__desc">Head of medical, physiotherapists, performance directors, and equipment managers at professional clubs. They are responsible for player availability and are often the first to recognize boot-related issues.</p>

                <h4 class="audience-card__sub">Pain Points</h4>
                <p>Limited influence over boot choices (driven by sponsorship deals). No objective data on boot-injury correlations for individual players. Reactive approach: treating boot-related injuries rather than preventing them.</p>

                <h4 class="audience-card__sub">Alveon Delivers</h4>
                <p>Data-driven boot fitting integrated into player health management. Evidence-based injury prevention. A Performance Center on-site that puts footwear into the medical staff's toolkit.</p>

                <h4 class="audience-card__sub">Pain Points</h4>
                <p>Existing manufacturing infrastructure cannot produce truly individualized products at any scale. Consumer demand for personalization is growing. Innovation pressure from competitors and from adjacent categories (running, basketball).</p>

                <h4 class="audience-card__sub">Alveon Delivers</h4>

                <p class="audience-card__desc">Seed and Series A investors, particularly those focused on deep tech, sports tech, and advanced manufacturing. Seeking ventures with defensible technology moats and clear commercial models.</p>

                <h4 class="audience-card__sub">Pain Points</h4>
                <p>Sports tech is often marketing-heavy and technology-light. Differentiation claims are difficult to validate. Market timing and go-to-market clarity are critical.</p>

                Alveon builds the world's first truly individualized football boots. We combine 3D scanning, biomechanical research, and advanced digital manufacturing to create boots shaped around the player, not around an average. Our mission is to reduce injuries, protect careers, and set a new standard for what professional equipment can be.

            <h2 class="reveal">Elevator Pitch <span class="tag">60 seconds</span></h2>
            <p class="reveal">Professional football players depend on their boots more than any other piece of equipment. Yet even the best boots on the market are mass-produced. Designed for statistical averages, not for the individual foot. Alveon changes this. We've built a complete digital pipeline: from 3D foot scanning and biomechanical analysis to 3D-knitted uppers and 3D-printed soles. Every boot is manufactured to the player's exact anatomy and movement profile. Our approach is backed by a two-year clinical study with three leading German research institutions. We're targeting EURO 2028 as our first major showcase and commercialize through Performance Centers: turnkey installations at clubs and brands that bring our scan-to-boot technology on-site.</p>

                    <dt>Global Brand Ambition</dt>
                    <dd>The visual identity should be conceived at the level of the world's leading sports and technology brands. This is not a startup aesthetic. It is the foundation for a global brand. Think long-term: the identity must work across boot design, digital platforms, physical spaces (Performance Centers), broadcast, and print.</dd>

                <div class="def-list__item">
                    <dt>Confidence Without Aggression</dt>
